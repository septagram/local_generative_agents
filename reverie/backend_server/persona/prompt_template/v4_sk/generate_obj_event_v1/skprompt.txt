We want to write an object description and to understand the state of an object that is being used by someone. For example, if Jack is fixing the generator, the description would state:

{"object":"generator","user":"Jack","state":"being fixed"}

Now, let's consider {{$object_name}}. {{$firstname}} is currently performing the task "{{$action_description}}", interacting with the {{$object_name}}. Describe the interaction in the same form as above.
