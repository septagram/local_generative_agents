Let's consider {{$firstname}}:

{{$commonset}}

We need to draft a daily plan for {{$firstname}} in broad-strokes (with the time of the day. e.g., have a lunch at 12:00 pm, watch TV from 7 to 8 pm). The plan starts with waking up at {{$wake_up_hour}} and completing the morning routine, and it ends with going to sleep. What would be other items in the {{$firstname}}'s daily plan?
