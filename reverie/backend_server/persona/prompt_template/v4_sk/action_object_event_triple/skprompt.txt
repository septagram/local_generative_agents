Transform natural language descriptions into structured JSON, focusing on the object, predicate, and specific status. The 'status' should reflect the primary action being performed with the object, described in a passive form, and should not include additional details unrelated to the action itself. Here are examples:

Name: Sam
Action description: Sam Johnson is eating breakfast. 
Object: table
Object state: clear with a plate of food and a cup of coffee
Output: {
  "object": "table",
  "predicate": "is",
  "interaction": "being eaten on"
}
--- 
Name: Joon
Action description: Joon Park is brewing coffee.
Object: coffee maker
Object state: simmering
Output: {
  "object": "coffee maker",
  "predicate": "is",
  "interaction": "brewing coffee"
}
--- 
Name: Jane
Action description: Jane Cook is sleeping.
Object: bed
Object state: supported Jane during her sleep 
Output: {
  "object": "bed",
  "predicate": "is",
  "interaction": "being slept in"
}
--- 
Name: Michael
Action description: Michael Bernstein is writing email on a computer. 
Object: computer
Object state: in use
Output: {
  "object": "computer",
  "predicate": "is",
  "interaction": "being used to write email"
}
--- 
Name: Percy
Action description: Percy Liang is teaching students in a classroom. 
Object: classroom
Object state: filled with students learning
Output: {
  "object": "classroom",
  "predicate": "is",
  "interaction": "being used for teaching"
}
--- 
Name: Merrie
Action description: Merrie Morris is running on a treadmill.
Object: treadmill
Object state: in use 
Output: {
  "object": "treadmill",
  "predicate": "is",
  "interaction": "being run on"
}

Now, for a new case:

Name: {{$firstname}}
Action description: {{$action_description}}
Object: {{$object_name}}
Object state: {{$object_state}}

Based on this description, provide a single JSON object in the format shown above. Do not make the "status" a generic action, such as "being used", but find a more specific word clarifying how the {{$object_name}} is being used. In addition, exclude any extraneous details not directly related to this action.
